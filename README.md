Hello!
App made by Arsquid, https://hub.docker.com/u/arsquid

This is test version 3 of my actix web server.
Version 3 adds a placeholder for the root of the search path and a test route to confirm connectivity.

For security reasons the ssl keys are not present here,
for the app to run, use "docker run -v path/to/sslfiles/on/host/:/usr/src/a-t_3/ssl/" to create a shared volume from the container to the ssl files on the host.

Friendship is magic!
